Preictal Seizure Analysis using Entropy and Bandpower Features

Overview
This repository contains a complete EEG signal processing and analysis pipeline developed using the Siena Scalp EEG Dataset.
The goal of this project is to analyze preictal EEG patterns using entropy-based features and frequency band power, and to explore their potential for seizure detection / early warning analysis.

The pipeline includes:
Raw EEG visualization
Signal preprocessing
Feature extraction (entropy & bandpower)
Statistical analysis and visualization
Threshold-based preictal detection


Dataset: Siena Scalp EEG Database
Source: PhysioNet

The dataset consists of multi-channel scalp EEG recordings from epilepsy patients, including interictal, preictal, and ictal periods.
⚠️ The dataset itself is not included in this repository.
Please download it separately from PhysioNet and update the file paths accordingly.
